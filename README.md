## Approach

I rewrote the project twice, the first time things just did not work well, eventually I started over and things went great from there by test & trial.
Overall time spent on project ~4 hours.

## Technology Stack

For the project, I have used the following technologies:
* Adobe Photoshop - cutting, resizing, image blurring.
* HTML5 - used RegEx patterns for `Password` and `Phone Number` inputs, added `*` sign for the important fields as well as a few pseudo-classes to help user experience with input fields.
* CSS3 + TailwindCSS - the page is supposed to be almost fully responsive, did not check for bugs as I didn't want to spend too much time on a *homework project*.
* JavaScript - a simple `passwordValidator()` function which validates whether the user has both password fields equal to each other, failing this task will prompt the user `"Password does not match."`

## Bugs

Shall you encounter any bugs, do not hesitate to open an issue!
